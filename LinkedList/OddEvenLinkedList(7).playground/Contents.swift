/*
 Given the head of a singly linked list, group all the nodes with odd indices together followed by the nodes with even indices, and return the reordered list. The first node is considered odd, the second node even, and so on.
 
 Example:

 Input: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5
 Output: 1 → 3 → 5 → 2 → 4

 Constraints:

 The relative order inside the odd and even groups should remain as in the input.

 Aim for O(1) space complexity and O(n) time complexity.
